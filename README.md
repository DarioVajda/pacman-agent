# Eutopia Pacman Contest - Winning Agent

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the winning agents for the **Eutopia Pacman Contest**, held in December 2024. The competition featured teams from multiple universities, competing in a sophisticated "Capture the Flag" variant of Pacman. I am proud to share that I placed **1st in the competition**.

## About the Contest

The Eutopia Pacman Contest is a team-based competition where agents, written in Python, navigate a divided Pacman map to:

- Defend their side from enemy Pacmen.
- Steal food from the opponentâ€™s side.
- Leverage power capsules to turn the tide by scaring enemy ghosts.

Participants needed to demonstrate a deep understanding of algorithms, AI techniques, and efficient decision-making under computational constraints. For more details on the contest rules and framework, refer to the official [documentation](https://github.com/aig-upf/pacman-contest).

## My Winning Strategy

### Agents Overview

My team comprised two custom-designed agents:

1. **Offensive  Agent**

   - Focused on infiltrating enemy territory to collect food and power capsules efficiently.
   - Leveraged strategic pathfinding, power capsule utilization, and food prioritization.

2. **Defensive  Agent**

   - Patrolled our side to prevent enemy Pacmen from stealing food.
   - Dynamically adjusted patrol points based on food and capsule locations.
   - Prioritized chasing visible Pacmen and predicting potential infiltrations.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Decision-Making**: Both agents used a combination of heuristic-based evaluations and forward simulations to predict and counter opponent actions.
- **Power Capsule Exploitation**: Offensively, the agents planned routes to maximize food collection after consuming a power capsule. Defensively, they ensured minimal exposure to enemy Pacmen.
- **Patrolling Strategy**: The defensive agent dynamically cycled through patrol points based on the distribution of food and capsules, adapting to the evolving game state.
- **Simulation-Based Evaluation**: The offensive agent utilized forward simulations to predict long-term outcomes of specific actions, balancing immediate rewards with future gains.

## Results

### Tournament Highlights

- **Final Rank**: 1st place

## Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the Pacman AI framework developed at UC Berkeley and extended by RMIT and UPF. I am grateful to the organizers and participants of the Eutopia Pacman Contest for creating such an intellectually stimulating competition.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as inspiration for your own AI projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

**Potential improvement**:

- Parametrise all the important constants used in my code and build a Genetic Algorithm that finds a more optimal solution through a tournament based selection and breeding.
